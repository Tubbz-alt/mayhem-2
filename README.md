I did (with my friend) this PC version of the game almost 10 years ago (2002), but it's apparently still working good on new PC (tested Windows 7 and Windows XP). We were very carefull to have the same "physic laws" so ship behavior/control is exactly the same as original (all gfx/sounds are the original ones). See original game (by Espen Skoglund): http://hol.abime.net/3853.

The goal of this project is to provide code base to people who would like to improve the game or just start another port of it. The code is using the Allegro graphic library (http://alleg.sourceforge.net/).

I guess many of old Amiga users had good time with this great game, I lately found again the code browsing an old hard drive, would be too bad if lost forever, so here it is, "as is".

Controls:

- Change background maps with 1, 2, 3

- Player 1: w(z), x, c, v, g

- Player 2: left arrow, right arrow, 0(num pad), .(num pad), Enter(num pad)

- Exit: ESC (you may need ALT+TAB)
